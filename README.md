Mapping MCPS: Understanding our schools
=======================================

The Montgomery County Public School system has a reputation for having "good schools" but what does that really mean? MCPS publishes data about the school system, but its all locked in PDF. And once we unlock it, what questions do we want to be able to answer?

How you can help
================

There are two main lines of work that would help move this project forward:
Data transfer - (help accepted now! see below)
Map building - (waiting on data entry)
